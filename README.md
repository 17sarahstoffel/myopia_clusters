# myopia_clusters
This is my solution to homework 20 for data bootcamp.


# Recommendation
Looking at the t-SNE scatter plot there appears to be 6 clusters, 5 outside clusters around a center cluster, and the elbow curve never really flatens out but could be slowing down around 7. Since neither model is clear in the amount of clusters I would recommend not clustering the patients.
